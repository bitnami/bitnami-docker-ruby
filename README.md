# Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DTC)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released daily with the latest distribution packages available.

# What are `prod` tagged containers for?

Containers tagged `prod` are production containers based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb). They contain the minimal dependencies required by an application to work.

They don't include development dependencies, so they are commonly used in multi-stage builds as the target image. Application code and dependencies should be copied from a different container.

The resultant containers only contain the necessary pieces of software to run the application. Therefore, they are smaller and safer.

Learn how to use multi-stage builds to build your production application container in the [example](/example) directory

# Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Ruby Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/ruby).

```bash
$ docker pull bitnami/ruby:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/ruby/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```bash
$ docker pull bitnami/ruby:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```bash
$ docker build -t bitnami/ruby:latest 'https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-ruby.git#master:2.7/debian-10'
```

# Entering the REPL

By default, running this image will drop you into the Ruby REPL (`irb`), where you can interactively test and try things out in Ruby.

```bash
$ docker run -it --name ruby bitnami/ruby:latest
```

**Further Reading:**

  - [Ruby IRB Documentation](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/irb/rdoc/IRB.html)

# Configuration

## Running your Ruby script

The default work directory for the Ruby image is `/app`. You can mount a folder from your host here that includes your Ruby script, and run it normally using the `ruby` command.

```bash
$ docker run -it --name ruby -v /path/to/app:/app bitnami/ruby:latest \
  ruby script.rb
```

## Running a Ruby app with gems

If your Ruby app has a `Gemfile` defining your app's dependencies and start script, you can install the dependencies before running your app.

```bash
$ docker run -it --name ruby -v /path/to/app:/app bitnami/ruby:latest \
  sh -c "bundle install && ruby script.rb"
```

or by modifying the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-ruby/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository: 

```
ruby:
  ...
  command: "sh -c 'bundle install && ruby script.rb'"
  volumes:
    - .:/app
  ...
```

## Accessing a Ruby app running a web server

This image exposes port `3000` in the container, so you should ensure that your web server is binding to port `3000`, as well as listening on `0.0.0.0` to accept remote connections from your host.

Below is an example of a [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) app listening to remote connections on port `3000`:

```erb
require 'sinatra'

set :bind, '0.0.0.0'
set :port, 3000

get '/hi' do
  "Hello World!"
end
```

To access your web server from your host machine you can ask Docker to map a random port on your host to port `3000` inside the container.

```bash
$ docker run -it --name ruby -P bitnami/ruby:latest
```

Run `docker port` to determine the random port Docker assigned.

```bash
$ docker port ruby
3000/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:32769
```

You can also manually specify the port you want forwarded from your host to the container.

```bash
$ docker run -it --name ruby -p 8080:3000 bitnami/ruby:latest
```

Access your web server in the browser by navigating to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).


# Connecting to other containers

If you want to connect to your Ruby web server inside another container, you can use docker networking to create a network and attach all the containers to that network.

## Serving your Ruby app through an nginx frontend

We may want to make our Ruby web server only accessible via an nginx web server. Doing so will allow us to setup more complex configuration, serve static assets using nginx, load balance to different Ruby instances, etc.

### Step 1: Create a network

```bash
$ docker network create app-tier --driver bridge
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '2'

networks:
  app-tier:
    driver: bridge
```

### Step 2: Create a virtual host

Let's create an nginx virtual host to reverse proxy to our Ruby container.

```nginx
server {
    listen 0.0.0.0:80;
    server_name yourapp.com;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header HOST $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;

        # proxy_pass http://[your_ruby_container_link_alias]:3000;
        proxy_pass http://myapp:3000;
        proxy_redirect off;
    }
}
```

Notice we've substituted the link alias name `myapp`, we will use the same name when creating the container.

Copy the virtual host above, saving the file somewhere on your host. We will mount it as a volume in our nginx container.

### Step 3: Run the Ruby image with a specific name

```bash
$ docker run -it --name myapp \
  --network app-tier \
  -v /path/to/app:/app \
  bitnami/ruby:latest ruby script.rb
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '2'
myapp:
  image: bitnami/ruby:latest
  command: ruby script.rb
  networks:
    - app-tier
  volumes:
    - .:/app
```

### Step 4: Run the nginx image

```bash
$ docker run -it \
  -v /path/to/vhost.conf:/bitnami/nginx/conf/vhosts/yourapp.conf \
  --network app-tier \
  bitnami/nginx:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '2'
nginx:
  image: bitnami/nginx:latest
  networks:
    - app-tier
  volumes:
    - /path/to/vhost.conf:/bitnami/nginx/conf/vhosts/yourapp.conf
```

# Maintenance

## Upgrade this image

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of Ruby, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container.

### Step 1: Get the updated image

```bash
$ docker pull bitnami/ruby:latest
```

or if you're using Docker Compose, update the value of the image property to `bitnami/ruby:latest`.

### Step 2: Remove the currently running container

```bash
$ docker rm -v ruby
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose rm -v ruby
```

### Step 3: Run the new image

Re-create your container from the new image.

```bash
$ docker run --name ruby bitnami/ruby:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose up ruby
```

# Notable Changes

## 2.3.1-r0 (2016-05-11)
- Commands are now executed as the `root` user. Use the `--user` argument to switch to another user or change to the required user using `sudo` to launch applications. Alternatively, as of Docker 1.10 User Namespaces are supported by the docker daemon. Refer to the [daemon user namespace options](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/userns-remap/) for more details.

## 2.2.3-0-r02 (2015-09-30)

- `/app` directory no longer exported as a volume. This caused problems when building on top of the image, since changes in the volume were not persisted between RUN commands. To keep the previous behavior (so that you can mount the volume in another container), create the container with the `-v /app` option.

## 2.2.3-0-r01 (2015-08-26)

- Permissions fixed so `bitnami` user can install gems without needing `sudo`.
